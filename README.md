# This is my first home server for the arduino uno
I have used code form: https://startingelectronics.com/tutorials/arduino/ethernet-shield-web-server-tutorial/SD-card-web-server-image/ 
to get the arduino working and modified based on the requests. 
Additionally, I have made a css style for my pages as well as wish my gf happy birthday instead of buying a card lol.
